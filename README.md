# Makefile

## a quick makefile on the fly for anyone who needs it, if anything isn't clear or doesn't work just ask.

### this Makefile works with the existence of an "Src" directory containing all your files in mind (the name can be everything you like not only Src) beacase it creates another directory containing the .o files in it and will eliminte it afterwards with the "clean" command
### essentially what I'm saying is "look out, cause it can and will delete all your work if used incorrectly"
